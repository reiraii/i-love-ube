# i love ube

Hello. Welcome to my website where I simply rant about my most favorite flavor in the world. 

## What is Ube?

Ube, also known as purple yam, is a popular root vegetable that originates from the Philippines, harboring a sweeter and more mellow taste compared to its starchy potato counterpart in most Western countries. It is often used in many popular Filipino desserts such as halo halo, ube halaya, ube ice cream, etc. and is an ingredient that most ethnic Filipinos grow familiar with and love throughout their life.



## Why I Love Ube
Althugh I cannot truly encapsulate the pure goodness and deliciousness of this vibrant purple delicacy through words on a screen, I will simply type in all capital letters to emphasize my point.

**UBE IS SO FREAKING GOOD OH MY GOD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**

Within my friend group, I am known as the one with the "Ube Addiction". To this, I ain rough time in my life where I ordered ube milk tea and ube desserts from Cafe 86 (which is a reallly good boba shop in town by the way I highly recommend) almost **every single day** to the point where my family and friends would joke about my skin turning purple due to th sheer amount of ube I consume on a daily basis.

However, HOW COULD I NOT THOUGH? Ube is so god dang good and I pity those who live their entire lives without the taste of this scrumptious purple yam ever touching their lips (I'm kidding). To whoever may be reading this public website written by a teenager who is overly obsessed with an oddly colored root vegetable. if you haven't tried ube before, **DO IT**. 

### Where Can I Try Ube?
There are many delicious places in town that harbor the most delectable purple treats and drinks, so here are some of my recommendations:
- Cafe 86 (my favorite out of the others, has the best selection of ube desserts and shakes that I could eat every day if I could)
- Kape Republik (personally recommend the ube crinkles and the Purple Rain drink they offer on their menu)
- SomiSomi (not necessarily a Filipino based food shop, but they do offer ube flavored ice cream which is really really good. What makes SOmiSomi stand out from other ube ice creams is that it is soft served on a Japanese taiyaki cake with custard filling on the inside, which is SOOOOOOOO good)
- Red Ribbon (this Filipino bakery is moreso for special events such as birthdays and other occasions, since I believe they have the best ube cake available. I have bought their cake for almost every birthday party of mine because it is my only annual excuse where I get to gobble down a giant purple cake of ube without judgement)
